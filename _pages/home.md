### Hello WORLD!

I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the <a href= "https://www.mpi-sws.org/"  target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Kaiserslautern, Germany</a>, in the <a href= "https://cossy.mpi-sws.org/"  target="_blank">Control Software Systems Group</a> led by <a href= "https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/"  target="_blank">Prof. Anne-Kathrin Schmuck</a>.

My research interest broadly includes Formal verification, Control theory, Artificial Intelligence, Formal methods and Automata theory. Specifically, my research vision is to apply formal methods and verification techniques to enhance the safety, security, and reliability of cyber-physical systems. You can find more details in my <a href= "../papers/raha_Research_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">Research Statement</a>.

I recently completed my joint Ph.D. (cotutelle) in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, Belgium and University of Bordeaux, France. My doctoral thesis, titled "Learning and Verifying Temporal Specifications for Cyber-Physical Systems", was supervised by <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/" target="_blank">Prof. Guillermo A. Perez</a> and <a href="https://nathanael-fijalkow.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow</a>. In my Ph.D., I worked on automatically synthesizing formal specifications from complex systems for <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank"> explainability</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification" target="_blank"> verification</a>. You can also explore my <a href= "../papers/raha_phd_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Ph.D. thesis</a> for more in-depth insights into this research.

I come from a Mathematical and Computer Science background. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href= "https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>, India.
