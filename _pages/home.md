### Hello WORLD!

I am a joint Doctoral student (cotutelle) in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, Belgium and University of Bordeaux, France. I am part of the Formal Techniques in Software Engineering (FOTS) lab of <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ansymo/" target="_blank"> AnSYMO research group</a> in UAntwerp and the Formal methods team in <a  href= "https://www.labri.fr/" target="_blank">LaBRI</a>, UBordeaux. My thesis is supervised by <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/" target="_blank">Prof. Guillermo A. Perez</a> and <a href="https://nathanael-fijalkow.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow</a>.


My research interest broadly includes Theoretical foundations of formal verifications, Artificial Intelligence, Formal methods and Automata theory and Games. Currently I am 
working on Ph.D. thesis entitled "Verification of Complex Systems against Learnt Specifications".


I come from a Mathematical and Computer Science background. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href= "https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>, India.
