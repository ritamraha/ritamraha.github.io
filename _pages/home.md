### Hello WORLD!

I am a joint Doctoral student (cotutelle) in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, Belgium and University of Bordeaux, France. I am part of the Formal Techniques in Software Engineering (FOTS) lab of <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ansymo/" target="_blank"> AnSYMO research group</a> in UAntwerp and the Formal methods team in <a  href= "https://www.labri.fr/" target="_blank">LaBRI</a>, UBordeaux. My thesis is supervised by <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/" target="_blank">Prof. Guillermo A. Perez</a> and <a href="https://nathanael-fijalkow.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow</a>.


My research interest broadly includes Formal verification, Artificial Intelligence, Formal methods and Automata theory. Specifically I focus on automatically synthesizing formal specifications from complex systems for <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank"> explainability</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification" target="_blank"> verification</a>. My other focus points are verification of formal models like counter automata using automata or logic-based approaches.

My ongoing doctoral thesis is entitled "Learning and Verifying Temporal Specifications for Cyber-Physical Systems".


I come from a Mathematical and Computer Science background. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href= "https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>, India.
