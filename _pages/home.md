### Hello WORLD!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href= "https://www.mpi-sws.org/"  target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a>, working in the <a href= "https://cossy.mpi-sws.org/"  target="_blank">Control Software Systems Group</a> led by <a href= "https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/"  target="_blank">Prof. Anne-Kathrin Schmuck</a>.

My research broadly lies at the intersection of Formal verification, Artificial intelligence, Control theory, Formal methods, and Automata theory. I focus on applying formal methods and verification techniques to improve the safety, security, and reliability of cyber-physical systems. More details can be found in my <a href= "../papers/raha_Research_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">Research Statement</a>.

I hold a joint Ph.D. (cotutelle) in Computer Science from the University of Antwerp and the University of Bordeaux, where I worked with <a href= "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/" target="_blank">Prof. Guillermo A. Perez</a> and <a href="https://games-automata-play.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow</a> on “Learning and Verifying Temporal Specifications for Cyber-Physical Systems.” My doctoral research explored the automatic synthesis of formal specifications for <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank"> explainability</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification" target="_blank"> verification</a>. You can also explore my <a href= "../papers/raha_phd_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Ph.D. thesis</a> for more in-depth insights into this research.

I come from a Mathematical and Computer Science background. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href= "https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>, India.
